## Objective 
For this assignment you will be using the command line to access the bamazon database that was created in MySQLWorkbench. Accessing this database allows the user to choose from an assortment of items by their product id which then prompts the user to input how many units they would like to purchase. 

## Steps
- Run 'bamazonCustomer.js' this will display all of the items for sale. This will show ids, names, prices of products for sale.
- The app will then prompt users with two messages.
  - The first will ask for the ID of the product
  - The second message will ask how many units you would like to buy.
- After submitting their request, the app will check to see if there is enough quanity of the product the user chose
